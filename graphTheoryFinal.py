## connected - path from any vertex to any other vertex

# euler cycle - all vertices have even degree, graph is connected
# & contains all edges and vertices of graph

# Euler trail - graph must have exactly two odd degree vertices, 
# vetices may be repeated, edges may not be repeated, graph is connected
# doesn't have to start and end at the same vertex


#  Write a program that takes an adjacency matrix for a graph and does the following:
# a. Checks to see if the graph is connected
# b. Checks to see if the graph has an Euler cycle
# c. If it has an Euler cycle, find the actual cycle
# d. If it doesnâ€™t have an Euler cycle, check to see if it has an Euler trail
# e. If it has an Euler trail, find the actual trail
